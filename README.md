# DevEasy

<p>Thinking about a Application what comes to mind, obviously it would be working on a own device but ever wondered about the speed with which this application would run if put on a system which provides a better configuration and efficient system. The thought of operatin system gives us a small idea of Windows, Mac and Linux, but ever thought of working on this system remotely through your internet.</p>
<br/>
<p>So, we provide a portable very handy to use online terminal and access to applications on a online Dev environment named "DEVEASY". A online space providing you the fastest and free to use web based terminal, applications and configurations for your desired project and development.
